## About
Mergeomics is an open source R-based pipeline for multi-dimensional integration of omics data to identify disease-associated pathways and networks. Genes whose network neighborhoods are over-represented with disease associated genes are deemed key drivers and can be targeted in further mechanistic studies.

More information can be found in the [paper](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-3198-9), [documentation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Mergeomics.html), and [web server](http://mergeomics.research.idre.ucla.edu).

## Tutorial
This tutorial describes the workflow for running the Mergeomics pipeline with individual scripts (using Mergeomics functions) and requires a minimum level of coding experience. This method allows for more customization and finetuning of the parameters. This is a response to the R package currently being under construction. 

For each step, example input and output files are given, the script, and discussion of the parameters.

There are example files for each input and output. 

#### Notes
All files used are tab delimited text files.

- A new version of the Mergeomics R package will be released which fixes minor bugs and improves results output. We suggest using source(Mergeomics_Version_1.99.Oct23.R) for the updated functions.
- All input files should be tab delimited .txt files.
- The term 'marker' is used to refer to any type of biological marker including loci, methylation/epigenetic sites, transcripts/genes, proteins, metabolites, etc.

All scripts except MDF need to source "Mergeomics_Version_1.99.Oct23.R".

### Marker Dependency Filtering

Marker dependency filtering (MDF) removes dependent markers and prepares an optimized marker and gene file for marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA). You must have the ldprune software installed for this script. The inputs are enumerated in the scripts as enumerated below. 

As of writing, MDF is done mostly for GWAS data (to correct for linkage disequilibrium). If starting from transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, or metabolomic data, start from MSEA (it is recommended to use the `runMSEA` function to simplify the analysis). 

#### Inputs
1. ```LOCFILE```: Disease/Phenotype Associated Data <br/> 
This file must have two columns named 'LOCUS' and 'VALUE' where value denotes the association to the trait of interest (p-value). The p-values must be negative log (base 10) transformed (-log P). The higher the value, the stronger the association.
```
LOCUS             VALUE
rs4747841         0.1452
rs4749917         0.1108
rs737656          1.3979
```
2. ```GENFILE```: Mapping File to Connect Markers from Association Data to Genes<br/>
(ex. eQTLs and/or Encode Information)
```
GENE              LOCUS
TSPAN6            rs1204389
TNMD              rs113630520
SCYL3             rs72691775
```
3. ```LNKFILE```: Marker Dependency File (ex. Linkage Disequilibirum)<br/>
LD files can be obtained from the [HapMap consortium](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/human/hapmap3.html). 
```
LOCUSa            LOCUSb              WEIGHT            
rs143225517       rs3094315           0.962305
rs4475691         rs950122            1
rs4475691         rs3905286           0.921467
```
4. ```OUTPATH```: Output Directory
5. ```NTOP```: Top proportion of associations to consider <br/>
To increase result robustness and conserve memory and time, it is sometimes useful to limit the number of markers. Use 0.5 as default; Try 0.2 for GWAS with high SNP numbers; Try 1.0 for GWAS with low SNP numbers

### Marker Set Enrichment Analysis
Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA) detects pathways and networks affected by multidimensional molecular markers (e.g., SNPs, differential methylation sites) associated with a pathological condition. The pipeline can be concluded after MSEA is run, or the results can be used directly in wKDA. 

MSEA can also be used for gene level enrichment analysis (functional annotation of DEGs, transcription factor target enrichment analysis) with different parameter settings. This is outlined below. Alternatively, you can use the `runMSEA` wrapper function without specifying a mapping_file.

#### Inputs
1.```label```: output file name<br/>
2.```folder```: output folder <br/>
3.```genfile``` and ```locfile```: Gene and loci files (respectively) from MDF (see outputs #1 and #2 from MDF section). For gene level enrichment analysis, a "fake" gene (mapping) file can be made. <br/>
4. ```modfile```: module/pathway file with headers 'MODULE' and 'GENE'
```
MODULE             GENE
rctm0573           APP
M5940              AMPH
Obesity_positive   CD53 
```
5. ```inffile```: description file for modules with headers 'MODULE', 'SOURCE', and 'DESCR'
```
MODULE             SOURCE           DESCR
rctm0573           reactome         Inflammasomes
M5940              biocarta         Endocytotic role of NDK, Phosphins and Dynamin
Obesity_positive.  GWAS Catalog     Positive control gene set for Obesity 
```
6. ```permtype```: This is critical. For GWAS enrichment analysis, use “gene”. For gene level enrichment analysis, use "locus"<br/>
7. ```nperm```: Set to 2000 for exploratory analysis, set to 10000 for formal analysis<br/>
8. ```maxoverlap```: Default is 0.33. Set to 1 for gene level enrichment analysis.

### Module Merging
This step merges redundant pathways (pathways with significant sharing of member genes) into relatively independent gene sets. The input for this script as exactly written below is the results file from MSEA (see output #4 from Marker Set Enrichment Analysis).

The minimum input for this script is a list of modules. If the user does post-analysis of the results file where the significant modules are already extracted, a text file with only one column 'MODULE' is sufficient for this script and the script can easily be modified to allow this. In the script below, lines with "##" are necessary if inputting a list of already filtered modules. Everything after the section "Merge modules before 2nd SSEA" requires only the list of modules. 

The output module file can be used as input for wKDA. 

This step is optional. Sigificant modules found from MSEA can be used for wKDA (with MODULE and NODE columns where NODE contains the genes).

#### Module Merge Script (R)
<em>See `merge_modules` in Mergeomics_utils.R for a wrapper function of this.</em>
```R

### Weighted Key Driver Analysis
Weighted key driver analysis (wKDA) selects key regulator genes of the disease related gene sets using gene network topology and edge weight information. wKDA first screens the network for candidate hub genes and then the disease gene-sets are overlaid onto the subnetworks of the candidate hubs to identify key drivers whose neighbors are enriched with disease genes. 

#### Inputs
1. Module file from merge modules or a file containing 'MODULE' and 'NODE' columns. See output #1 from Module Merging. 

2. Network file 
```
TAIL		HEAD        WEIGHT
A1BG		SNHG6       1
A1BG		UNC84A      1
A1CF		KIAA1958    1
```


#### wKDA Script (R)
<em>See `runKDA` in Mergeomics_utils.R for a wrapper function of this.</em>
```R
job.kda <- list()
job.kda$label<-"wKDA"
job.kda$folder<-"Results" ## parent folder for results
## Input a network
## columns: TAIL HEAD WEIGHT
job.kda$netfile<-"bayesian_network.txt"
## Tab delimited text file of gene set containing two columns: MODULE, NODE
## Outputs from Module Merge script can be directly used
job.kda$modfile<-"merged_modules.txt"

## "0" means we do not consider edge weights while 1 is opposite.
job.kda$edgefactor<-1
## The searching depth for the KDA
job.kda$depth<-1
## 0 means we do not consider the directions of the regulatory interactions
## while 1 is opposite.
job.kda$direction <- 1
job.kda$nperm <- 2000

moddata <- tool.read(job.kda$modfile)
mod.names <- unique(moddata$MODULE)
moddata <- moddata[which(!is.na(match(moddata$MODULE, mod.names))),]
## save this to a temporary file and set its path as new job.kda$modfile:
tool.save(moddata, "subsetof.supersets.txt")
job.kda$modfile <- "subsetof.supersets.txt"

## Let's run KDA!
job.kda <- kda.configure(job.kda)
job.kda <- kda.start(job.kda)
job.kda <- kda.prepare(job.kda)
job.kda <- kda.analyze(job.kda)
job.kda <- kda.finish(job.kda)

job.kda <- kda2cytoscape(job.kda)
```

### Outputs
If significant key drivers were found, "cytoscape" and "kda" directories are made containing input files for cytoscape and kda results. 


## Workflow using wrapper functions

This functions can be found in Mergeomics_utils.R. The most common values for certain settings are set as default parameters in these wrapper functions. Please review above to see descriptions on these different parameters and they may be tweaked in the following functions. Generally the minimum input is depicted below.

```R
source("Mergeomics.R")
source("Mergeomics_utils.R")
```

### GWAS Enrichment

```R
runMDF(LOCFILE = "./GWAS/Kunkle_AD.txt",
       GENFILE = "./mapping/Brain_Hippocampus.eQTL.txt", 
       LNKFILE = "./linkage/LD50.1000G.CEU.txt", 
       output_dir = "./MSEA/Data/", # if more than one directory, must create beforehand such as in this case
       ldprune = "./GWAS/ldprune")
runMSEA(MDF_output_dir = "./MSEA/Data/Kunkle_AD.Brain_Hippocampus.eQTL/",
        marker_set="./HP_MSEA_DEGs.txt")
runKDA(MSEA_results_dir = "./Results/msea/", #contains only one set of results with one "-.results.txt" file
       marker_set="./HP_MSEA_DEGs.txt",
       network="./network/brain_network.txt")
# OR
runKDA(nodes_file = "./Results/msea/Kunkle_AD.Brain_Hippocampus.eQTL.results.txt",
       marker_set="./HP_MSEA_DEGs.txt",
       network="./network/brain_network.txt")
```

### Transcriptome/Proteome/Epigenome/Metabolome Enrichment
```R
runMSEA(association = "./Microglia_DEGs.txt", # has DEGs in LOCUS column and -log10 transformed p values in VALUE column
        marker_set="./genesets/kbr.mod.txt",
	info="./genesets/kbr.info.txt") # info not required
runKDA(MSEA_results_dir = "./Results/msea/Microglia_DEGs.results.txt",
       marker_set="./genesets/kbr.mod.txt",
       network="./network/brain_network.txt")
```

### Run KDA on genes
```R
runKDA(nodes_file = "./HP_MSEA_DEGs.txt",
       network="./network/brain_network.txt")
```

### Skip MDF for GWAS and run MSEA (not recommended for formal analysis) 
```R
runMSEA(association_file = "./GWAS/Kunkle_AD.txt", 
        perc_top_associations = 0.5,
        mapping_file = "./mapping/Brain_Hippocampus.eQTL.txt",
        marker_set="./HP_MSEA_DEGs.txt")
```

#### Extra notes
We understand the confusion with 'LOCUS' as the column name as opposed to 'MARKER'. In the scripts and ldprune program provided in this github page, 'LOCUS' needs to be the column name as opposed to 'MARKER'. We hope to change to 'MARKER' soon to reflect that SNP, gene, protein, and metabolite information can be used. To clarify, 'LOCUS' can contain <b>any</b> type of information, though LOCUS implies location in genome (SNP).
